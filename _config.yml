about-author: "<p><strong>I am looking for a PhD position starting from Fall 2020.</strong></p>
I am a machine learning and remote sensing researcher. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in June 2019. 
My thesis was about using deep learning to generate beautiful maps with satellite data and limited training samples, supervised by Dr. Qian Shi. 
I was a Remote Sensing Engineer at OneSpace Technology, where I developed new models for crop classification and PM2.5 estimation. 
<p>I will join <a href='http://nightsky.physics.hku.hk'>the HKU Light Pollution ECF Team</a> in the coming year to study the condition of light pollution in Hong Kong.</p>"
news: "<p><strong>July 2019: </strong> I started working at OneSpace Technology in Chongqing as a Remote Sensing Engineer. </p>
  <p><strong>June 2019: </strong> I received my bachelor's degree in Geographical Information Science from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.</p>
  <p><strong>March 2019: </strong> Our journal paper on <a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11060690'>land use and land cover mapping by integrating object-based regularization and ConvNets using optical and PolSAR data</a> was available online.</p>
  <p><strong>February 2019: </strong> We achieved top 2% (18/1329) in preliminary and top 3% (29/1329) in semifinal in the Alibaba Cloud German AI Challenge 2018 for Remote Sensing Scene Classification of Local Climate Zones.</p>
  <p><strong>March 2018: </strong> Our work about using active learning to reduce the need of labeled samples for remote sensing image classification was accepted to IGARSS 2018.</p>"
