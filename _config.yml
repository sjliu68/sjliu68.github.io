about-author: "<p><strong>I am seeking a PhD position starting from 2020.</strong></p>
I am a machine learning and remote sensing researcher. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in June 2019. My thesis was about using deep learning to generate beautiful maps with satellite data and limited training samples, supervised by Dr. Qian Shi. I was a Remote Sensing Engineer at OneSpace Technology, where I developed new models for crop classification and PM2.5 estimation. I will join the HKU Light Pollution ECF Team in the coming year to study the condition of light pollution in Hong Kong."
