My last year in campus was really a mess. When I finished defending my thesis in May, I had zero desirable offers.  So when the HR of OneSpace Technology (*零壹空间*) called me that morning, I was thrilled. We had quite a chat and she mentioned that she was also graduated from Sun Yat-sen Univ. At that time I was actually offered a job as remote sensing engineer in some public institution where they offered, let's say not a very satisfactory salary, and the last thing I want to do is to stay in a state-owned institution considering what happened in SYSU. I told them I had an offer from a state-owned institution and it would be better for them to arrange the next round interview quickly. 

## So they did

It was probably the next morning that she told me the next interview could be arranged in the afternoon. The scheduled time was conflict with the other interview with XSpark Education (*星火教育*). Here's what I planed to do. I went to the building where XSPark Education located, TaiKoo Hui Guangzhou. I took the interview with OneSpace Technology in TaiKoo Hui, and then after the interview I went to the XSPark Education's office, though eventually I missed the interview and didn't go another interview they offered.

Some might ask why I took the interview with OneSpace Technology so seriously? First of all, it is a start-up company making rockets and I think I like to work in such a young company instead of an overstaffed organization. I am also curious about rockets as well (who didn't?). Second, I checked their salary range and it was really high at that time considering I had zero offers in hand. Last but not least, I can still work as a remote sensing engineer and it would probably be good for me to leave Guangzhou for some time.

Back to the interview, it was the first time I met ZHOU Liang (*周亮*), the team leader of spatial information department. He looked like what you imagine as a middle-aged (30s) man in China who achieved some success in business. In the 20-min interview, he asked near zero question about the details of remote sensing but a lot about what I wanted and the life and future might be in OneSpace. Two days later an official offer came so I declined the offer at the public institution. It was a relieve and I finally started to plan my graduation trip. Things in and after Japan turned out even better and I shall write about it latter. 

## First impression of Chongqing


My father insisted to go to Chongqing with me. We took an early flight on July 4 from Zhuhai. It was not the first time I came here. I was in Chongqing for two days last year as a traveller. 

The company was really far from the downtown. It took almost one hour to there.
