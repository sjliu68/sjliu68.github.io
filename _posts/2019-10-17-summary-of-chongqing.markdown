My last year in campus was a mess. When I finished defending my thesis in May, I had zero desirable offers.  So when the HR of OneSpace Technology (零壹空间) called me that morning, I was thrilled. We had quite a chat and she mentioned that she was also graduated from Sun Yat-sen University.

At that time I was actually offered a job as remote sensing engineer in some public institution, where they offered, let's say not a very satisfactory salary, and the last thing I want to do is to stay in a state-owned institution considering what happened in my life. I told OneSpace that I had an offer from a state-owned institution and hoped they can hurry up the interview. 

**So they did.**

## Interview with OneSpace

They offered me the next round interview the next afternoon. The scheduled time was conflict with my interview with XSpark Education (星火教育). Here's what I planed to do. I went to the building where XSpark Education located, TaiKoo Hui Guangzhou. I took the interview with OneSpace Technology in TaiKoo Hui, and then after the interview I went to the XSPark Education's office, though eventually I missed the interview with XSpark and didn't go another interview they offered.

Some might ask why I took the interview with OneSpace so seriously. Things were complicated. First of all, it is a start-up company making rockets and I like it. I am also curious about rockets (who didn't?). Second, I checked their salary range and it was really high in the so-called GIS&RS community. Besides, it would probably be good for me to leave Guangzhou for some time.

Back to the interview, it was the first time I met ZHOU Liang (周亮), the team leader of spatial information department. He looked like what you imagine as a middle-aged (30s) man in China that achieved some success in business. In the 20-min interview, he asked near zero question about the details of remote sensing but a lot about what I wanted and the life and future might be in OneSpace. 

Two days later came the offer letter. It was a relief and I finally started to plan my graduation trip. Things in and after my trip to Japan turned out even better and I shall write about it later. 

## First impression of Chongqing

My father insisted to go to Chongqing with me. We took an early flight on July 4 from Zhuhai. It was not the first time I came to Chongqing. I was here for two days last year as a traveler. 

The company was far from the downtown and it took almost one hour from the airport. I didn't have the time to rest as they asked me to come, have a unofficial meeting and sign the contract. I felt a little excited when I saw those rockets, but I didn't get paid that day (and the day I left). 

They asked me to go for a field study and collect some samples. I was surprised that no one in the company had some basic knowledge of remote sensing. They didn't think about collecting samples when they needed to classify rape flowers, paddy, corn, etc. I started to miss my classmates. I think they will understand what I said if we were working together on a project...

### Collecting samples in mountains

Anyway, I went to a small town surrounded by mountains on a Saturday. I didn't feel too bad at first, as I thought this trip could help me get some experience on field studies, and I did. But it was hot, really hot, and things became meaningless as the farmlands in Chongqing were too fragmented to be classified in an image with 10-m spatial resolution. The budget was limited. We could only use the free Sentinel data at that time. 

### Back to the city

We planned to stay there for two and half days, but I decided to go home the next morning, so I could still have almost a day with my father hanging around the city. It was the first time he took the flight and went so far from home. It was weird for Chongqing to have so many restaurant serving Peking Duck. We went one in JieFangBei (解放碑). The foods there were delicious and surprisingly cheap!!

## The hard times

Things didn't go well latter. I've tried many algorithms and had an overall accuracy around 80% for the mapping of crop types. But when they checked the result with the aerial images captured by UAV (0.3 m), they claimed that there were a lot of misclassification. At first I didn't believe it and I went to check the classification. BTW, the aerial images were confidential and could only be browsed on the computers in a government-owned office. 

They were not wrong. Some of the paddy and even water were misclassified, but it seemed the OA was around 70-80 %, as indicated by the confusion matrix. It was really hard to distinguish the rape flowers on the aerial images because the images were captured in the winter when the rape flowers were barely grown. Sichuan pepper (花椒) was also confused with Longan trees and orange trees. In my defense, I don't think a satellite image with 10-m resolution could complete  the job. 

The next week I was in the office to manually edit the classification map based on visual interpretation. But it was hard to tell on the aerial images as well, and we guessed. I had many feelings regarding the current land use and land cover mapping algorithms when facing the computer editing the shapefile... 


## The nights in GuanYinQiao (观音桥)

in the late July, all the works were done and we could take a break, meaning having our own time in weekends finally.  The company was located in the middle of nowhere (no restaurant offered delivered services!) and the condo I rent was nearly in the middle of nowhere (no MCDonald's at least). So I would go to the downtown, had a decent dinner and played LOL overnight. 

It was fun. I liked it, practiced a lot with Timor and become better! Now I think if at that time I planned for TOEFL or GRE instead of wasting my time, I would probably be more competitive in applying PhD. So, what I learned here is that I must be a city boy instead of a country guy and your jobs will take away your energy. Hope I will make a wise decision for the next 4-5 years. 

## Time to say goodbye
