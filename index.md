I am currently a research assistant at The University of Hong Kong, studying night lights with my colleagues under the supervision of Dr Jason Pun. <a href="http://globeatnight-network.org">Check out the Globe at Night - Sky Brightness Monitoring Network!</a>
<br>
<br>
Before HKU, I received my bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University. I've developed an interest in remote sensing image classification in my four-year study.
My thesis was about land cover mapping using deep learning, with methods including optical-PolSAR fusion, active learning, and transfer learning.

**Recent activities**
* **1 July 2020**: One paper entitled "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2020.3005076">Active Ensemble Deep Learning for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Classification</a>" is accepted by IEEE GRSL.

* **15 April 2020**: One paper entitled "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.04.008">Local Climate Zone Mapping as Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Deep Learning: A Case Study of Metropolitan China</a>" is accepted by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing! Check out the local climate zone project <a href="https://sjliu.me/lcz">here</a>! 


* **24 December 2019**: One paper (coauthered with Dr Qian Shi) is accepted by IEEE GRSL!<br>
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954933">Multitask Deep Learning With Spectral Knowledge for Hyperspectral Image Classification</a><br>

* **November 2019: I won the second prize (5000 CNY) in a paper contest** <br>
The contest was hosted by Zhuhai Orbita Sci & Tech Co., Ltd.and Geomaticser (慧天地). In the paper, I developed a new method using neural networks and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral data to estimate PM2.5 concentration. Code is available here. I also developed a python tool to convert raw Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral data to TOA reflectance.

* **March 2019: One paper is accepted by Remote Sensing**<br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11060690">Object-Based Post-classification Refinement with CNNs for Land Cover Mapping Using Optical and PolSAR data</a><br>
This paper describes an novel method to empower CNNs to produce object-based classification maps, named "Object-Based Post-classification Refinement" (OBPR).
In the paper, we also analyzed the effect of fusing Sentinel optical and PolSAR data in urban land cover mapping.<br>

* **April 2018: National Undergraduate Project** <br>
We successfully applied for a National Undergraduate Innovative Project (No.201810558050, 10, 000 CNY) at SYSU from Ministry of Education of China. The project is about using DMSP/OLS night lights to capture the collapse and rise of the post-Soviet states and exploring their relationship with land use types.

* **March 2018: One paper accepted to IGARSS 2018** <br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517855">Wide Contextual Residual Network With Active Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification</a><br>
